                            # ASSESSMENT 2
# 1. Write a python program to check if a year is a century year or not using Conditional Statements.

def is_century_year(year):
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if is_century_year(year):
    print(f"{year} is a century year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a century year.")

# 2. Write a program to determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using Conditional Statements.

def given_number(num):
    if num > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif num < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Zero"
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
result = given_number(number)
print(f"The number '{result}'.")

# 3. Write a program for a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division using 
# Conditional Statements.

y = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
operator = input("Enter operator (+, -, *, /) ")
z = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
if operator == '+':
    print (y + z)
elif operator == '-':
    print (y - z)
elif operator == '*':
    print (y * z)
elif operator == '/':
    print (y / z)
else:
    print('invalid operator')

# 4. Write a Python Program using While Loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.
x = 1
total = 0
while x <= 100: 
    total = total + x
    print (total)
    x = x +1

# 5. Write a python program using while loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.
    #Wrong answer
    
number = 2
while number <= 50:
    print(number)
    number += 2

# 6. Write a python program using For Loop that iterates over a list of numbers and prints out each number.
    
list = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
for number in list:
    print (number)

# 7. Write a Python Program using the For Loop to print the multiplication table of 5.

for num in range (1,12):
    print (f" 5 x {num} = {5 * num}") 

# 8. Write a Python Program using the For Loop that iterates over a list and checks whether each number is greater 
#    than 3.

list = (1, 2, 7, 9)
for number in list:
    if number >= 3:
        print (number, 'greater than 3')
    else:
        print (number, 'not greater than 3')

# 9. Create a python program to print the multiplication tables of different numbers in a range using nested loops.

for a in range (1, 8):
    for b in range (1, 12):
        print (f"{a} x {b} = {a * b}")

# 10.Write a python program using  nested loops to print a right angled triangle using stars

for a in range (1, 8):
    for b in range (1, a +1):
        print ('*',end= '')
    print()
